# General-Purpose-DSU-Library-in-C++
This project consists of a General Purpose DSU library in C++ and can be used in Competitive Programming Contests. We need to include the header file in our code and we can make a DSU Data Structure like:

DSU d(n);

The functionalities provided are:
1) Construct a DSU data Structure with n groups.
2) We could add new group to our DSU.
3) Find the leader of a group.
4) Find the number of elements which exist in a group.
5) Merge two existing groups using Union function.

For optimisation, Path Compression heuristics and Union by rank is used.
